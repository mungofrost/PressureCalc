For non-commercial and non-weapons related uses do what you want with the code and buy me a drink if you think it was useful enough and we ever meet.

For commercial use first print three copies of the code: bury one in your garden, nail one to a telegraph pole and mail the third to the president of the United States.  Then you may use the code.

For weapons use go have a long hard think about what youâ€™re doing, then you may use the code.
